# Deep-learning-Face-Extraction--from-vedio-using-MTCNN-
Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN) model is used for face detection. This model has three convolutional networks (P-Net, R-Net, and O-Net) and is able to outperform many face-detection benchmarks while retaining real-time performance.
